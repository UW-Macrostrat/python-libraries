"""Helpers for building bite-sized test rasters.

Test rasters are *generated*, not committed: a few hundred pixels of synthetic
categorical data is enough to exercise footprints, asset selection, compositing
and rendering, and it keeps binary fixtures out of the repository. Shared here
rather than in a test file so `macrostrat.raster_layers` — and Macrostrat's own
integration tests — can use the same fixtures.
