# Changelog

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-25

- Fix: a mounted layer advertised URLs that 404. `register_raster_layers` now
  tells each factory the prefix it is mounted at, so TileJSON `tiles` entries
  (and any WMTS templates) resolve. `RasterLayerConfig.router()` takes an
  optional `prefix`

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-25

- A mosaic advertises the zoom range its rasters actually resolve, rather than
  the tile grid's 0-24. Affects `/info`, `tilejson.json` and WMTS capabilities;
  serving is unchanged, so overscaled tiles still render
- Bounds and zoom range come from one query, so backend construction still costs
  a single round trip
- Requires `macrostrat.raster_index` 0.3.1

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-23

- `?datasets=` narrows a mosaic to specific rasters by slug, so a single dataset
  can be viewed through the layer — keeping its palette, class vocabulary,
  transparent empty tiles and per-asset point queries — rather than through a
  separate single-file route. Applies to tiles, `/point`, `/info`, `/assets` and
  `/footprints`, via titiler's `backend_dependency`
- Requires `macrostrat.raster_index` 0.3.0

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-22

- Serve a transparent PNG where a layer has no coverage, instead of a bodyless
  204. mapbox-gl treats a 204 as a successful response and then fails to decode
  the empty body, so every tile past the edge of the data surfaced as "the image
  could not be decoded". `/point` and non-PNG formats keep the 204

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-22

- Filter a categorical mosaic to named classes:
  `?algorithm=classes&algorithm_params={"classes":["Kaolinite"]}`. Applied after
  compositing, so excluded classes are masked and survivors keep the layer's
  palette
- New `/layer` route reporting a layer's palette and class vocabulary, so a
  client can build a legend without reading a raster
- Requires `macrostrat.raster_index` 0.2.0, which carries `categories` on assets

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-12

- Resolve colormaps from the assets a tile read already fetched, rather than
  caching them or querying separately: `set-colormap` and later edits take effect
  on the next tile, with one database query per tile instead of two
- Requires `macrostrat.raster_index` 0.1.1, whose selection moved out of stored
  functions into the package

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-12

- Initial release: `PGRasterMosaic` (a rio-tiler mosaic backend reading assets
  from `macrostrat.raster_index`), `RasterMosaicFactory`, canned
  `RasterLayerConfig` layers, and a `raster_footprints` vector-tile layer
