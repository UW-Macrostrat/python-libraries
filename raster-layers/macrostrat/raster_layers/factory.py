"""FastAPI routes for serving indexed raster layers.

`RasterMosaicFactory` is titiler's `MosaicTilerFactory` with the index bound in
as its backend. Since rio-tiler 8 moved the mosaic backend contract into
rio-tiler itself, every route titiler registers — tiles, tilejson, info, point,
assets — works against an index-backed mosaic unchanged. What's added here is
the layer's own default colormap and a footprints layer.
